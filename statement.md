# ???? BloomBuddy Project Statement

## ???? Problem Statement

Most people just don't remember to water their plants in time, which negatively affects their health and growth. BloomBuddy resolves this very common problem by offering a reminder system that's easy: it remembers the watering schedule for your plants and lets you know when they need care.

Project Scope
BloomBuddy is a console-based Python application that allows users to:
- Add plants with a custom watering interval.
- Track the last watered date for each plant.

- Receive reminders when the plants are due for watering.

- List all the plants currently stored in the system.

The project demonstrates the syllabus concepts of problem solving, modular programming, data structures, and algorithm design, connecting theory with a practical real-world application.
-
Target Users

- Home gardeners who want to keep their plants healthy.

- Students learning programming concepts through real-world projects.
- Anyone interested in building simple, useful console applications.

High-Level Features

- **Plant Management:** Add, list, and update records of plants.

- **Reminder System:** Check which plants need to be watered today.
- **Error Handling:** Handle invalid inputs elegantly.
- **Modular Design:** Separate files for main menu, plant management, reminders, and utilities
The ultimate objective of the process is to recreate and simulate the function of self-renewal and differentiation in vitro for the exogenous conversion of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells into functional cells, such as retinal epithelium and retinal neurons.
