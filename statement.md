PLANT PAL PROJECT STATEMENT 

PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Most people just don't remember to water their plants in time, which negatively affects their health and growth.
Plant Pal resolves this very common problem by offering a reminder system that's easy. 
It remembers the watering schedule for your plants and lets you know when they need care.

SCOPE OF PROJECT
Plant Pal is a console-based Python application that allows users to:
- Add plants with a custom watering interval.
- Track the last watered date for each plant.
- Receive reminders when the plants are due for watering.
- List all the plants currently stored in the system.
The project demonstrates the syllabus concepts of problem solving, modular programming, data structures, and algorithm design, connecting theory with a practical real-world application.

TARGET USERS
- Home gardeners who want to keep their plants healthy.
- Busy working individuals who have difficulty watering their plants timely due to their packed schedules.
- Students learning programming concepts through real-world projects.


High-Level Features

- Plant Management: Add, list, and update records of plants.
- Reminder System: Check which plants need to be watered today.
- Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs elegantly.
- Modular Design: Separate files for main menu, plant management, reminders, and utilities
